This website is for a fictional restaurant called Banh Mi Nguyen. The purpose of the site is to help the restaurant reach out to more potential customer through the Internet by introducing the quality of the food, the menu, the location and the enthusiastic team.
This site's basic editing methods is the same as any other default Wordpress site: Add new page by going to Pages tabs, add new content using blocks in posts/pages, add menu using menu tab, etc. However, we used some plugins to improve the site's visuals.
The plugin we used is called Fonts Plugin | Google Fonts Typography, which enable us to change the font of the whole site.
